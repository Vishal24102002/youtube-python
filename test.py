#hello guys we are here to show you the code for factorial without using maths module
#so without wasting time lets begin now
a=int(input("enter the number"))
b=a
for i in range(1,a,1):
    a=a*i
print("the factorial of ",b," is =",a)
# here we go lets begin you can aslo define another veriable to make your code look more effective 
#hence firstly we have to test it now lets test it out
# the code is working properly as required
